# why no turing complete ðŸ¥º

```haskell
wtf : Top -> Bot
wtf triv := wtf triv

dead : Bot
dead := wtf triv

-- in fact. it doesnt need to be a function
absurd : Bot
absurd := absurd
```

- with unrestricted recursion, we have proven that Bot has a value after all
- I don't think I need to explain why this is very not good
- turing completeness is overrated anyways
