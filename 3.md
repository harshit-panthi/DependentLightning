# Enter Dependent Types!

- basically, functions can appear in types and the return type of a function can depend on the input
```haskell
foo : Nat -> Type
foo 0 := Bool
foo _ := String

bar : (n : Nat) -> (foo n)
bar 0 := false
bar _ := "KOSS!!!"
```

- and in structs and tuples, the types of members can depend on previous members (called dependent sum (sometimes dependent pair) types)
example:
```haskell
baz : (n : Nat, foo n)
baz := (0, false)

qux : (n : Nat, foo n)
qux := (1, "spooky")

whatever : (Nat, String)
whatever := (0, "boring")
```

- Note : this is still a strongly typed language
- Note : Dependent function types are also written as ```Π (a : A) (f a)``` and dependent sum types are also written as ```Σ (a : A) (f a)```
