# What if..

- ## the type of a value could depend on another value
  somewhat like:
```haskell
a : Nat
a = 0

b : ???
b = if (a = 0) then (4) else "Hello"
```

but then what would be the type of b?

- ## the return value of a function could depend on the input
  somewhat like:
```haskell
f : ???
f x = if (x = 0) then (4) else "Hello"
```
