# Curry-Howard Correspondance

- You *must* have noticed the many parallels between Set Theory and Logic
- Like how statements seem to correspond to sets, their truth values to whether their corresponding sets are empty or not, their conjuctions to the intersections of correponding sets, their disjunctions to the unions of their corresponding sets, and their negations to the complements of their corresponding sets

well it turns out that some people noticed some pretty similar parallels between Logic and *programming!!!*

| Logic                                  | Programming                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Statement                              | Type                                           |
| Proof                                  | Value                                          |
| Statement is true                      | Type has a value                               |
| Statement is false                     | Type doesn't have a value                      |
| Trivially true statement               | The type 'Top'                                 |
| Trivially false statement              | The type 'Bot'                                 |
| Conjunction ('and')                    | Product type (struct)                          |
| Disjunction ('or')                     | Sum Type (enum)                                |
| Negation ('not')                       | A funtion type to 'Bot' (A -> Bot)             |
| p => q                                 | The function type P -> Q                       |
| Universal Quantification (∀x∈X P(x))   | The dependent function type (x : X) -> (P x)   |
| Existential Quantification (∃x∈X P(x)) | The dependent sum/pair type (Σ (x : X), (P x)) |

This means that in a language with dependent types (and some restrictions, more on this later), we can mathematically prove anything in that language that we can prove by doing mathematics on paper. We can prove things about abour programs (ensuring reduced (read almost zero) bugs), and much more
