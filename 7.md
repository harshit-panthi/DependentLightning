## But wait
- ### wouldn't writing programs and then writing proofs about them take too much time
- ### Imagine writing many proofs for every single function you have
## Well... no.
- ### well first of all, you don't have to write proofs. You can just write programs and be done with it.
- ### But thats not all
- ### remember that in this system, every type is a statement, and every program is a proof, so in a way, all you're doing is wiritng proofs
- ### This is not just a technically true statement...
